Hi there!\
I'm Maia Czerwonka, a Statistics and Honors Psychology undergraduate student at the University of Washington. Currently, I am a student researcher at the [Cognition and Cortical Dynamics Laboratory](https://sites.uw.edu/ccdl/) (CCDL) where I am actively researching individual differences in how people respond to conflicting information, as well as infirmation presented in different modalities. 
Previously, I was a research assistant on the PARC, uCLIMB, and Arrivals projects at the CCDL.\
\
This summer, I will be in Seoul, South Korea, working as a Data Analyst Intern.
\
You can see some of my research work on [GitHub](https://github.com/maiacz) and [here]() for information on the research that won me the Mary Gates Research Scholarship!
\
In 2024, I presented at the Mary Gates Research Symposium, which I will be doing again in 2025. Take a look at my [symposium]() and my [poster]().

### Publications
Currently, I have a paper in prep that I am aiming to publish by Spring 2026.
