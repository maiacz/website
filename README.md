Hi there!\
I'm Maia Czerwonka, a Statistics and Honors Psychology undergraduate student at the University of Washington. Currently, I am a student researcher at the [Cognition and Cortical Dynamics Laboratory](https://sites.uw.edu/ccdl/) (CCDL) where I am actively researching individual differences in how people respond to conflicting information, as well as infirmation presented in different modalities. 
Previously, I was a research assistant on the PARC, uCLIMB, and Arrivals projects at the CCDL.\
\
This summer, I will be in Seoul, South Korea, working as a Data Analyst Intern.

You can see some of my research work on [GitHub](https://github.com/maiacz) and [here](https://www.maiacz.com/Guthrie_Prize_Research_Proposal.docx) for information on the research that won me the Mary Gates Research Scholarship!

In 2024, I presented at the Mary Gates Research Symposium, which I will be doing again in 2025. Take a look at my [poster](https://www.maiacz.com/Mary_Gates_Research_Symposium_Poster.pdf) and the [day of the symposium](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/maiacz_last-friday-i-had-the-opportunity-to-present-activity-7198810546857529344-jvAT?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAADp3m-QBGP6I8aiJpycGIB_0WUmnzfCRlDY)!
